## Getting Started

Recess is an app designed to make it easier to find & create local pickup games or leagues. Users are able to search through a database of games created by other users, add their own, and edit or delete games. They are also able to see the exact location of the game using a Google Map plugin.

To see the live version, navigate to http://recessgames.herokuapp.com (Mobile Friendly)

Here's a animation of the workflow:
